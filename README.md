## 💾 Storage: Disk Images and Host Access

The emulator supports two primary types of storage: virtual disk images for standard DOS drives (A:, B:, C:, D:) and direct access to the host filesystem via a mapped network drive (H:).

### Virtual Floppy and Hard Disks (Drives A:, B:, C:, D:)

The emulator supports up to two floppy disk drives (A: and B:) and up to two hard disk drives (C: and D:). Disk images are stored on the SD card.

The emulator expects the following file paths and names for the disk images:

*   **Floppy Drive 0 (A:):** `\\XT\\fdd0.img`
*   **Floppy Drive 1 (B:):** `\\XT\\fdd1.img`
*   **Hard Drive 0 (C:):** `\\XT\\hdd.img`
*   **Hard Drive 1 (D:):** `\\XT\\hdd2.img`

**Important Notes:**

*   The disk type (floppy or hard disk) is determined by the drive number it is assigned to in the emulator, not by the filename itself.
*   The emulator automatically determines the disk geometry (cylinders, heads, sectors) based on the size of the image file. Ensure your disk images have standard sizes for floppy disks (e.g., 360KB, 720KB, 1.2MB, 1.44MB) for proper detection. For hard disks, the geometry is calculated based on a standard CHS (Cylinder/Head/Sector) layout.

### Host Filesystem Access (Drive H:)

For seamless file exchange, the emulator can map a directory from the host filesystem and present it as drive **H:** in the DOS environment. This feature is implemented through the standard **DOS network redirector interface (INT 2Fh, Function 11h)**.

This is ideal for development, allowing you to edit files on your host machine and access them instantly within the emulator without modifying disk images.

#### How It Works

The emulator intercepts file operations for drive H: and translates them into commands for the host's filesystem. To enable this drive, you must run the `MAPDRIVE.COM` utility within the emulator.

The mapped directory depends on the platform:

-   **On Windows builds:** Drive H: maps to the `C:\\FASM` directory by default.
-   **On Linux builds:** Drive H: maps to the `/tmp` directory by default.
-   **On Pico builds (RP2040/RP2350):** Drive H: maps to the `//XT//` directory on the SD card.

#### `MAPDRIVE.COM` Utility

The `tools/mapdrive.asm` source file can be assembled into `MAPDRIVE.COM` using FASM. This utility registers drive H: with the DOS kernel as a network drive.

**Prerequisite:** Before using `MAPDRIVE.COM`, ensure your `CONFIG.SYS` file contains the line `LASTDRIVE=H` (or higher, e.g., `LASTDRIVE=Z`). This tells DOS to allocate space for drive letters up to H:, allowing `MAPDRIVE.COM` to successfully create the new drive.

To use it:

1.  Assemble `mapdrive.asm` to `mapdrive.com`.
2.  Copy `mapdrive.com` to your boot disk image (e.g., `fdd0.img` or `hdd.img`).
3.  Run `MAPDRIVE.COM` from the DOS command line.
4.  Add `MAPDRIVE.COM` to your `AUTOEXEC.BAT` to automatically map the drive on boot.

### ⚙️ Platform-specific Details
The emulator's resource allocation changes based on the target platform and build options.

#### Conventional RAM (`RAM_SIZE`)
This is the amount of memory available to the emulated PC as conventional memory (e.g., the classic 640KB).

| Platform | Memory Configuration | Available RAM |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Host** | N/A                  | 640 KB        |
| **RP2350**| PSRAM (default)      | 350 KB        |
| **RP2350**| Virtual Memory       | 200 KB        |
| **RP2040**| PSRAM (default)      | 116 KB        |
| **RP2040**| Virtual Memory       | 72 KB         |

#### Audio Sample Rate (`SOUND_FREQUENCY`)
The audio quality depends on the platform and the chosen audio output method.

| Platform | Audio Option         | Sample Rate |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Any      | `HARDWARE_SOUND=ON`  | 44100 Hz    |
| **Host** | Any other option     | 44100 Hz    |
| **RP2350**| Any other option     | 44100 Hz    |
| **RP2040**| Any other option     | 22050 Hz    |

### Extended Memory (EMS/XMS)
To run more advanced DOS applications and games, the emulator supports two types of extended memory systems, providing memory beyond the conventional 640KB limit. The active system is chosen at compile time.

#### 1. PSRAM (Pseudo-Static RAM)
This is the high-performance default method, used when a hardware PSRAM chip is available.
*   **How it works:** It directly communicates with an external PSRAM chip over a high-speed SPI interface, managed by the Pico's PIO and DMA for maximum performance.
*   **When to use:** This is the recommended option for all platforms that have a PSRAM chip (like the RP2350 or custom boards). It provides the best performance for applications requiring EMS or XMS memory.
*   **Configuration:** Enabled by default. For RP2350, use the `ONBOARD_PSRAM=ON` option. For external PSRAM, ensure the pinout is correct.

#### 2. Virtual Memory (Swap File)
This is a fallback system for hardware that lacks a PSRAM chip, primarily intended for memory-constrained RP2040 boards.
*   **How it works:** It implements a paging system using a swap file named `pagefile.sys` located in the `\\XT\\` directory on the SD card. The Pico's internal RAM is used as a cache for memory "pages". When the requested memory is not in the cache (a page fault), it is read from the SD card.
*   **Performance:** This method is significantly slower than PSRAM due to the latency of SD card access. You may notice the Pico's LED flash when the system is "swapping" pages to and from the SD card.
*   **When to use:** Use this option only on hardware without PSRAM. It provides compatibility for applications that require more memory than is physically available on the Pico, at the cost of performance.
*   **Configuration:** Enabled by setting `TOTAL_VIRTUAL_MEMORY_KBS` to a non-zero value (e.g., `-DTOTAL_VIRTUAL_MEMORY_KBS=512`). This will automatically disable the PSRAM driver.

## 🏛️ Platform Architecture
The emulator uses different architectures depending on the target platform to best utilize the available resources.

### Raspberry Pi Pico (Dual-Core)
The Pico build takes full advantage of the RP2040/RP2350's dual-core processor.
*   **Core 0:** Runs the main CPU emulation loop (`exec86`) and handles user input from the PS/2 keyboard and NES gamepad.
*   **Core 1:** Dedicated to real-time, time-critical tasks. It runs an infinite loop that manages:
    *   Video rendering (at ~60Hz).
    *   Audio sample generation and output.
    *   PIT timer interrupts for the emulator (at ~18.2Hz).

This division of labor ensures that the demanding CPU emulation does not interfere with smooth video and audio output.

### Windows & Linux (Multi-threaded)
The host builds (for Windows and Linux) are multi-threaded to separate tasks.
*   **Main Thread:** Runs the main CPU emulation loop (`exec86`) and handles the window and its events via the MiniFB library.
*   **Ticks Thread:** A dedicated thread that acts as the system's clock. It uses high-resolution timers (`QueryPerformanceCounter` on Windows, `clock_gettime` on Linux) to trigger events like PIT timer interrupts, rendering updates, and audio sample generation at the correct frequencies.
*   **Sound Thread:** A separate thread responsible for communicating with the host operating system's audio API (WaveOut on Windows, a custom backend on Linux) to play the generated sound without blocking the other threads.

This architecture allows for accurate timing and responsive I/O on a non-real-time desktop operating system.

### 📦 Build Outputs

After successful compilation, build artifacts are placed in the `bin/<platform>/<build_type>/` directory.

#### For host builds:
*   **Executable:** `286` (Linux) or `286.exe` (Windows).

#### For Pico builds:
The firmware filename is dynamically generated to reflect the build configuration, following this pattern:
`286-<platform>-F<flash>-P<psram>-<cpu_freq>-<display>-<audio>.uf2`

*   **`<platform>`**: `RP2040` or `RP2350`.
*   **`F<flash>`**: Flash frequency (e.g., `F100` for 100MHz).
*   **`P<psram>`**: PSRAM frequency (e.g., `P166` for 166MHz).
*   **`<cpu_freq>`**: CPU frequency in MHz (e.g., `504MHz`).
*   **`<display>`**: `TFT`, `VGA`, `HDMI`, or `NTSC`.
*   **`<audio>`**: `I2S`, `PWM`, or `HW` (Hardware).

**Example Filenames:**
*   `286-RP2350-F100-P166-504MHz-HDMI-I2S.uf2` (Pico2 with HDMI, Butter-PSRAM)
*   `286-RP2350-F100-P166-378MHz-VGA-PWM.uf2` (Pico2 with VGA, external PSRAM)
*   `286-RP2040-F100-P166-366MHz-VGA-PWM.uf2` (RP2040 with VGA)

The following files are generated:
*   `.uf2`: The firmware file for flashing to the Pico.
*   `.elf`: The executable file for debugging.
*   `.bin`: The raw binary file.

### 🎯 Flashing to Pico

1. **Hold the BOOTSEL button** while connecting your Pico to USB
2. **Copy the `.uf2` file** to the mounted RPI-RP2 drive  
3. **The Pico will automatically reboot** and start running the emulator

### 💾 Setting up Disk Images

    ├── fdd0.img    # Floppy Drive A:
    ├── fdd1.img    # Floppy Drive B: (optional)
    ├── hdd.img     # Hard Drive C:
    └── hdd2.img    # Hard Drive D: (optional)
```

#### For Linux/Windows host builds:
Place disk images in the project root directory:
```bash
# From your project directory (pc/)
# Place disk images directly in the root:
cp your-boot-disk.img fdd0.img     # Floppy Drive A:
cp your-floppy2.img fdd1.img       # Floppy Drive B: (optional)  
cp your-harddisk.img hdd.img       # Hard Drive C:

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Build fails with "display/audio option required":**
- Ensure exactly one `ENABLE_*` option is set for both display and audio

**Linux build fails with "X11 not found":**
- Install X11 development headers: `sudo apt install libx11-dev`
- On other distributions: `sudo dnf install libX11-devel` (Fedora) or `sudo pacman -S libx11` (Arch)

**Host build shows "DISK: ERROR: cannot open disk file":**
- Ensure disk images are in the project root directory (not build directory)
- Check file permissions: `chmod 644 *.img`
- Verify disk images exist: `ls -la *.img`

**Linux emulator window appears but shows black screen:**
- Ensure you have a bootable disk image in `fdd0.img`
- Check disk image format is valid DOS/PC format
- Try running from terminal to see debug messages

**Out of memory errors on RP2040:**
- Try enabling virtual memory: `-DTOTAL_VIRTUAL_MEMORY_KBS=512`
- Use smaller disk images
- Disable unused emulation features

**HDMI not working:**
- Ensure CPU frequency is correct (automatic with `ENABLE_HDMI=ON` - 504MHz for Pico2, 378MHz for others)
- Check HDMI cable and display compatibility
- Verify power supply can handle HDMI output requirements

**PSRAM detection issues:**
- Check GPIO pin configuration for your hardware (MURM20: GPIO 8, PIMO: GPIO 47, default: GPIO 19)
- Ensure PSRAM chip is properly powered and connected
- Try manual PSRAM configuration if auto-detection fails

**Performance issues:**
